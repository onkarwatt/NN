This repository contains Python programs related to various topics in Artificial Neural Networks as part of the curriculum at the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, Savitribai Phule Pune University.

### 1. Plot Activation Functions
   - Python program to plot several activation functions commonly used in neural networks.

### 2. McCulloch-Pitts Neural Net
   - Generate the ANDNOT function using the McCulloch-Pitts neural network.

### 3. Perceptron Neural Network for Number Recognition
   - Python program using a perceptron neural network to recognize even and odd numbers represented in ASCII form (0 to 9).

### 4. Perceptron Learning Law Demonstration
   - Demonstrate the perceptron learning law and its decision regions with a suitable example using Python. Output is provided in graphical form.

### 5. Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM)
   - Python program implementing Bidirectional Associative Memory with two pairs of vectors.

### 6. Number Recognition Using Matrix Representation
